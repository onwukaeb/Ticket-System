//this will show all the files you have changed in red.

2. git add -A or git add .
 
//this will stage all your changed files for commit.

3. git commit -m 'Change summary'

//this commits your changes and provides a brief summary on what they did.

4. git push origin master

//this pushes your changes to the main repository on github.
